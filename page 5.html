			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p> My name is Ksenia. I am studying in the direction of Modern Communications and I am fond of video and photography.  From children's short films, shot with friends on the first video camera, to large-scale projects. Soon I was attracted to various small projects: to take pictures of schoolchildren, to make video visuals â€“ everything is the simplest. And then the guys from the Student Council noticed me, and a lot of work, more serious tasks and events began. After a while I felt that I wanted to go further and not be limited to events.
			<br></br>
	
			<br>My style is small documentaries, which calmly and unhurriedly, but at the same time excitingly tells about the history of a person. I choose classical, elegant music that does not prevent me from revealing all the beauty of this day and the events taking place. I pay great attention to color. In each film, it is different, corresponding to the place, the weather and the story itself.</br>
